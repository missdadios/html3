<h2>About Me</h2>
<div class="profile">
<p>Welcome to My Profile!
</br>
</br>
I’m <strong>Ivy Chanelle Dadios,</strong> a Software Quality Engineer with a degree in Bachelor of Arts in Multimedia Studies from the University of the Philippines Open University. My passion for understanding how people engage with digital experiences led me to pursue a degree in Multimedia Studies, where I balanced both the creative and technical aspects of user experience. Now, as a Master of Information Systems student, I'm diving deeper into the world of technology, with a focus on Computer Science courses as part of my electives—something I’ve always dreamed of pursuing.
</br>
</br>
For me, quality goes beyond just ensuring functionality. It’s about crafting seamless, intuitive experiences that truly resonate with users. As a Software Quality Engineer, I ensure that every system I work on meets the highest standards, runs efficiently, and delivers exceptional user experiences. My background in Multimedia fuels my commitment to understanding the user perspective, and my electives in Computer Science are helping me sharpen my technical expertise to build even better solutions.
</br>
</br>
Driven by curiosity, creativity, and an ever-growing passion for learning, I embrace every opportunity to expand my skills. Whether through workshops, webinars, or hands-on projects, I’m excited to continue blending my creative vision with cutting-edge technology to create impactful user-centered designs. </p> </div>
